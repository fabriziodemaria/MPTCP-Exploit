##IMPORTANT

The scapy code within this repo has been cloned from: https://github.com/nimai/mptcp-scapy
I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE SCAPY CODE WITHIN THIS REPO.

Since I might need to perform some modifications to Scapy code in order to build my test scenarios, I cloned the original code. If I notice that my contribution would be valuable, a proper fork and PR will be performed.
The original material from this repo only include the python modules in the root, used to setup the network scenarios.
